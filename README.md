# zcerti

Get HTTPS certificates from a Web site via the ICM trace (transaction code SMICM) and upload them to STRUST.

Initial idea from [here](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/6720#issuecomment-1873742763) to read the ICM trace and parse the certificates,
and credits to [MBT here](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues/6720#issuecomment-1877376292) for uploading the certificates to STRUST.
